# Overview

For this project, I have learned the steps in how to make a Tic Tac Toe game using Pygame. After learning those steps, I studied what to do and what to look for, then applied it.

Similar to a regular game of Tic Tac Toe, you click one of the squares within the 3x3 grid. It naturally starts with X (Player 1), then immediately switches over to O (Player 2). With each click on the grid, it switches between players until the game is over.

The purpose of this software is to teach myself how Pygame works and how to apply it in the code.

# Future Work

* Much like last time, continue the pursuit to manage my time better
* Learn more about the math equations in the middle for a better understanding of image placement
* Find ways to fix the audio...
